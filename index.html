								<b>Analyzing Distributions of Stellar Obliquities </b><br>Performing statistical analysis using Python to determine obliquity distributions of Kepler systems and control stars. By examining the distribution of obliquities in systems beyond the Sun, this research will contribute to development and refinement of theories about the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Advised by Dr. Joshua Winn.

								<b>Exoplanet Characterization Using TESS and Gaia</b><br>Incorporated high precision photometry and light curve data from two telescopes (TESS and Gaia) into light fitting procedures to determine the characteristics of two exoplanetary systems, HATS-34 and HATS-46. Developed coding skills in BASH and Python and honed research ability. The resulting paper was submitted to MNRAS and is under review. Advised by Dr. Joel Hartman.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Mars Special Regions: A Model of Biological Isolation</b><br>Developed a model of microbial transport and burial on Mars to assess the feasibility of biologically isolating zones on Mars from terrestrial contamination. Analyzed results of microorganism survival in UV radiation and created models of survival during transport and burial by dust storms. Synthesized results to determine policy implications of the modeling. The resulting paper is in preparation for publication. Advised by Dr. Christopher Chyba.
